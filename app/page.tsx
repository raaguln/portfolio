      <p>Hello there! I am Raagul. I have spent 3+ years crafting and deploying performant software applications at Conde Nast. 
        A few of the notable achievements that I'm proud of are -</p>
      <ul>
        <li>decreasing the load time of a website from 15+ seconds to under 2s, which lead to our team landing 4x more 
          sponsored projects. (implementation discussed at <PrettyLink href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HhWIvPhbu0&t=8681s" target="_blank">this conference</PrettyLink>)</li>
        <li>leading development on WIREDâ€™s data-driven <PrettyLink href="https://www.wired.com/story/welfare-state-algorithms/" target="_blank">storytelling website</PrettyLink> 
        {" "}that visualized the outcome of biased real-world AI systems. (name credited at the footer)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Thoroughly captivated by the data science behind the WIRED's investigation, I moved from India to Seattle (WA, USA) 
        to unravel the mysteries of data science and AI at the <span className={spanCN}>University of Washington</span>. With this as an additional toolkit to 
        my skillset, I seek to implement data-driven approach to solving business problems, and build performant and end-to-end
        fullstack products that help the users.</p>
      {/* <p>
      Now, I'm actively honing my skills by exploring diverse projects, ranging from{" "}
      <span className={spanCN}>churn analysis</span>{" "}to the cutting-edge realm of {" "}
      <span className={spanCN}>fine-tuning large language models</span>. Through these endeavors, 
      I'm gaining hands-on experience with experimental design methodologies and statistical machine learning, 
      solidifying my foundation for a future in ethical and impactful data science.
