      I worked on developing an explanatory website for WIRED that highlighted the 
      issues of data bias and simplified machine learning interpretability 
      in Rotterdam's welfare fraud detection algorithm. This experience fueled 
      my desire to delve deeper into the field, propelling me to the{" "}
      <span className={spanCN}>Master's in Data Science</span> program at the{" "}
      <span className={spanCN}>University of Washington, Seattle</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Now, I'm actively honing my skills by exploring diverse projects, ranging from{" "}
      <span className={spanCN}>churn analysis</span>{" "}to the cutting-edge realm of {" "}
      <span className={spanCN}>fine-tuning large language models</span>. Through these endeavors, 
      I'm gaining hands-on experience with experimental design methodologies and statistical machine learning, 
      solidifying my foundation for a future in ethical and impactful data science.
